# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, 
the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

This is a Kaggle Competition Project, Here We have a task to predict whether a Passenger Survived or Not. In this project we detect passengers by his/her Passenger ID. 

The algorithms used in survival prediction are: Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). 

Here I used Random Forest with 79% accuracy.

Although both the RF and the SVM models were very competitive in terms of prediction accuracy, the SVM surpassed the RF with an accuracy of 83.9% versus 82.5% for the RF.
